== 0.7.1

- Add adapter and driver for H2 courtesy of Caleb Land
- Fix "undefined method `last' for {}:Hash" error introduced with new Rake 0.8.1 (JRUBY-1859)

== 0.7

- PLEASE NOTE: This release is not compatible with JRuby releases earlier than
  1.0.3 or 1.1b2. If you must use JRuby 1.0.2 or earlier, please install the
  0.6 release.
- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.3 and JRuby 1.1b2 releases
- Simultaneous support for JRuby trunk and 1.0 branch
- Get rid of log_no_bench method, so we time SQL execution again.
- Implement #select_rows
- MySQL migration and quoting updates

== 0.6

- Gem is renamed to "activerecord-jdbc-adapter" to follow new conventions
  introduced in Rails 2.0 for third-party adapters. Rails 2.0 compatibility is
  introduced.
- Add dependency on ActiveRecord >= 1.14 (from the Rails 1.1.x release)
- New drivers (jdbc-XXX) and adapter (activerecord-jdbcXXX-adapter) gems
  available separately. See the README.txt file for details.
- Plain "jdbc" driver is still available if you want to use the full
  driver/url way of specifying the driver.
- More bugfixes to Oracle and SQLServer courtesy of Ola & ThoughtWorks

== 0.5

- Release coincides with JRuby 1.0.1 release
- It is no longer necessary to specify :driver and :url configuration
  parameters for the mysql, postgresql, oracle, derby, hsqldb, and h2
  adapters. The previous configuration is still valid and compatible, but for
  new applications, this makes it possible to use the exact same database.yml
  configuration as Rails applications running under native Ruby.
- JDBC drivers can now be dynamically loaded by Ruby code, without being on
  the classpath prior to launching JRuby. Simply use "require
  'jdbc-driver.jar'" in JRuby code to add it to the runtime classpath.
- Updates to HSQL, MS SQLServer, Postgres, Oracle and Derby adapters
